Grace is a security administrator for a medical institution and is responsible for many different teams. One team has reported that when their main FDDI connection failed, three critical systems went offline even though the connection was supposed to provide redundancy. Grace has to also advise her team on the type of fiber that should be implemented for campus building-to-building connectivity. Since this is a training medical facility, many surgeries are video recorded and that data must continuously travel from one building to the next. One other thing that has been reported to Grace is that periodic DoS attacks take place against specific servers within the internal network. The attacker sends excessive ICMP Echo Request packets to all the hosts on a specific subnet, which is aimed at one specific server.

Tom's company has been experiencing many issues with unauthorized sniffers being installed on the network. One reason is because employees can plug their laptops, smartphones, and other mobile devices into the network, any of which may be infected and have a running sniffer that the owner is not aware of. Implementing VPNs will not work because all of the network devices would need to be configured for specific VPNs, and some devices, as in their switches, do not have this type of functionality available. Another issue Tom's team is dealing with is how to secure internal wireless traffic. While the wireless access points can be configured with digital certificates for authentication, pushing out and maintaining certificates on each wireless user device is cost prohibitive and will cause too much of a burden on the network team. Tom's boss has also told him that the company needs to move from a landline metropolitan area network solution to a wireless solution.

What should Tom's team implement to provide source authentication and data encryption at the data link level?
A. IEEE 802.1AR
B. IEEE 802.1AE
C. IEEE 802.1AF

Sandy has just started as the manager of software development at a new company. As she interviews her new team members, she is finding out a few things that may need to be approached differently. Program- mers currently develop software code and upload it to a centralized server for backup purposes. The server software does not have versioning control capability, so sometimes the end software product contains outdated code elements. She has also discovered that many in-house business software packages follow the Common Object Request Broker Architecture, which does not necessarily allow for easy reuse of distributed web services available throughout the network.

Grace is a security administrator for a medical institution and is responsible for many different teams. One team has reported that when their main FDDI connection failed, three critical systems went offline even though the connection was supposed to provide redundancy. Grace has to also advise her team on the type of fiber that should be implemented for campus building-to-building connectivity. Since this is a training medical facility, many surgeries are video recorded and that data must continuously travel from one building to the next. One other thing that has been reported to Grace is that periodic DoS attacks take place against specific servers within the internal network. The attacker sends excessive ICMP Echo Request packets to all the hosts on a specific subnet, which is aimed at one specific server.

Which of the following is the best type of fiber that should be implemented in
this scenario?
A. Single mode
B. Multimode
C. Optical carrier
D. SONET
B

Sean is the new security administrator for a large financial institution. There are several issues that Sean is made aware of the first week he is in his new position. First, spurious packets seem to arrive at critical servers even though each network has tightly configured firewalls at each gateway position to control traffic to and from these servers.

Tom's company has been experiencing many issues with unauthorized sniffers being installed on the network. One reason is because employees can plug their laptops, smartphones, and other mobile devices into the network, any of which may be infected and have a running sniffer that the owner is not aware of. Implementing VPNs will not work because all of the network devices would need to be configured for specific VPNs, and some devices, as in their switches, do not have this type of functionality available. Another issue Tom's team is dealing with is how to secure internal wireless traffic. While the wireless access points can be configured with digital certificates for authentication, pushing out and maintaining certificates on each wireless user device is cost prohibitive and will cause too much of a burden on the network team. Tom's boss has also told him that the company needs to move from a landline metropolitan area network solution to a wireless solution.

What should Tom's team implement to provide source authentication and data encryption at the data link level?
A. IEEE 802.1AR
B. IEEE 802.1AE
C. IEEE 802.1AF
D. IEEE 802.1X

Lance has been brought in as a new security officer for a large medical equipment company. He has been told that many of the firewalls and IDS products have not been configured to filter IPv6 traffic; thus, many attacks have been taking place without the knowledge of the security team. While the network team has attempted to implement an automated tunneling feature to take care of this issue, they have continually run into problems with the network's NAT device. Lance has also found out that caching attacks have been successful against the company's public-facing DNS server. He has also identified that extra authentication is necessary for current LDAP requests, but the current technology only provides password based authentication options.

Based upon the information in the scenario, what should the network team implement as it pertains to IPv6 tunneling?
A. Teredo should be configured on IPv6-aware hosts that reside behind the NAT device.
