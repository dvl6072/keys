The FAT tracks the___while the directory entry tracks the___.
The FAT tracks the location of the last cluster for a file (EOF), while the directory entry maintains the file's starting cluster number


How many copies of the FAT does each FAT32 volume maintain in its default configuration.
Each volume maintains two copies (one for backup): FAT1 and FAT2.


A file's logical size is displayed as.
A file's logical size is displayed as the actual number of bytes that the file contains

The area between a file's logical size and its physical size is commonly referred to as slack space


What three things occur when a file is created in a FAT32 file system.
The directory structure records the file's information, the FAT tracks the number of clusters allocated to the file, and the file's data is filled in to the assigned clusters.


How does EnCase recover a deleted file.
EnCase recovers deleted files by first obtaining the file's starting cluster number and its size from the directory entry. Encase determines the number of clusters needed based on the file's size and then attempts to recover the data from the starting extent through the amount of clusters needed


What does EnCase do when a deleted file's starting cluster number is assigned to another file.
When EnCase determines that the starting cluster in the FAT has been reassigned to an existing file, it reports the previously deleted file as being overwritten.


What information does a file's directory entry in a FAT file system store about itself.
A file's directory entry stores almost everything about the file with the exception of the actual data itself. (File name, date/time, file extension, starting cluster(extent))
